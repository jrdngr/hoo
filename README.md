# Hoo

A collection of tools to control Philips Hue lights on my local network. 

This is me learning Rust, REST API design, various frontend frameworks, concurrency, database stuff, and basically anything else I want to learn in the future. It is not intended to be production quality software. 

I'm in the middle of rewriting the server and Hue client with `hyper` to take advantage of `async/.await` and to get myself a little bit closer to dealing with HTTP.

I'm also rewriting the frontend with `Yew`. It was originally written in Vue back before I used Vue at work. Now that it's part of my job, I wanted to move to something Rust-based and new to me.
